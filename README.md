## Introduction
The Unified Daughterboard Project is an open standard to unify the USB daughterboards used in custom mechanical keyboard projects.  
The Unified Daughterboard allows designers to easily implementing electrical protection via a tested proven PCB, and allows users to maintain and repair their keyboards in the future.  
  
For more details on the Unified Daughterboard project, see the [main website](https://unified-daughterboard.github.io/).


## C4 version

The C4 daughterboard is the current most recent revision to the classic square form-factor daughterboard, with its roots in the C1 which was designed to be compatible with Wilba's keyboards.
The daughterboard features the following:

- ESD protection, overcurrent protection, overvoltage protection, shielding noise decoupling, and single-path grounding to chassis functionality
- New Molex Pico-EZmate Connector, replacing the JST-SH on previous versions
- 1:1 connector pinout to retain compatibility with existing PCBs
- Same form factor as the older C3 series, allowing for daughterboard upgrades


## Using C4 in your design
Please [visit the docs](https://unified-daughterboard.github.io/) for detailed implementation references and notices.
